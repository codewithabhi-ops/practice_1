this is the first day of having my laptop
my tank goddam its a fucking tank 
it is heavy durable rough and tough 
battery life is damn so goood bro 
it contains two batteries that provides a fucking great run time
keyboard doesn't has backlight though i wanted that but its okay
the keys are working fine and that is all that one needs for a keyboard right
the ports are working fine and the charger is also a lenovo original
so the body is in black color looks super cool and 
camera is also working fine though the quality is not like a mobile camera but it works 
process the things at a pretty good speed that is a good sign for me 
i mean i can perform tasks and run things smoothly
bro its super cool for a 20k laptop
