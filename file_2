so it looks a bit cool 
not that typical as i assume things 
the interface is really okay 
like you can create repositories and create files in that repository
you can create as much as you want actually 
its nice
you can put as many repos as you want and you can create as many files as you want not a big deal
it will look after 
like it will simply save the changes that we make here
commit changes ans get them reviewed within minutes bro! hahaha
