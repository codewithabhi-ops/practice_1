its amazing
creating containers running applications on namespaces and containers. scaling the containers when needed and then shutting them out!
balancing the load using load balancer, autoscaling and autohealing process. 
going serverless, means we up the container or server if we are using a vm based server when there comes a request 
from the client and then responding the client. and then when the session got complete, we stop the server or stop the container. means we up the 
server when needed or else its not there also called as going serverless. damn it! so cool is that ain't it?
