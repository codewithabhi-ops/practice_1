so this is really nice
like you can create repos and files inside of it but
i want to know how to interact with this github using the git program enabled in my os
like for local system i need to install git in my laptop. in this ms os 
but if want to access my github by installing git in my ubuntu instance server
i need to make connection off course like how does the git program knows what is your account in github and only then you would be able to access github after making the connection
and here comes http or ssh connection
which helps our git program to find our id on github
okay let's see let's go then...
